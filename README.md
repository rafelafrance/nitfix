# Installation

You will need to have Python3 installed, as well as pip, a package manager for python. Beyond these, it is easiest to handle dependencies by setting up a virtual environment, which is a contained workspace with internally installed python libraries. Run the following code in what you intend to be your working directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/rafelafrance/nitfix.git
cd path/to/cloned/nitfix
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

You should see something like `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt after running the second line, indicating the environment is active. Once you have verified that the requirements installed with no errors, only the second line needs to be run before each nitfix session.

If you choose not to use virtual environments, you will likely have to specify python3.
