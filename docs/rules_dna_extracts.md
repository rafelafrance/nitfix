#  Toss list

1. Toss everything with a value <1 (not <=). This means <1 ng/uL or <100 ng total DNA.
1. Priority rules.
   1. Must have one representative of each genus.
   1. If we have <= 5 species TOTAL in a genus, submit everything we have.
   1. If we have >5 but <=12 species TOTAL in the genus, submit 50% of what we have.
   1. If we have >12 species in a genus, submit 25% of what we have.
1. Whenever you execute part (2) â€” can the tossing of species be not completely random but favor higher DNA yield?
- The rules are not consistent, numerically.
